## 📖 What is Dispatcharr?

Dispatcharr is an **open-source powerhouse** for managing IPTV streams and EPG data with elegance and control.  
Born from necessity and built with passion, it started as a personal project by [**OkinawaBoss**](https://github.com/OkinawaBoss) and evolved with contributions from legends like [**dekzter**](https://github.com/dekzter), [**SergeantPanda**](https://github.com/SergeantPanda) and **Bucatini**.  

> Think of Dispatcharr as the *arr family’s IPTV cousin — simple, smart, and designed for streamers who want reliability and flexibility.
